# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges.

It contains folders for each year, which in turn contain folders for each day. Each day folder contains the input data and the solution code.

The solutions are written in a mix of languages, though mainly Typescript.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference or inspiration for your own solutions.
